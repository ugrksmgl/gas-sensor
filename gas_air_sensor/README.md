# gas-air-sensor
ATTiny45/85 Arduino code for reading MQ-2 and MQ-5 based gas and air quality sensors and internal adc line for attiny temperature sensor, and transmitting at priority based intervals (sigmoid) over a data line (preferably fed to a 433mhz transmitter) using the pimatic probe library.

Requirements:

Hardware:
ATTiny45/85
315mhz / 433mhz / any other transmitter.
USBASP or any other ATTiny programmer.

Software:
Arduino Studio

Hardware Setup: TODO

Credits: Pimatic Probe to transmit data as a generic sensor.
